    "# Intelligent Robotics Workflow Management #\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics, effective task management is very crucial for a smooth operation. This is a project on developing a **Smart Task Scheduling System** for robots using a **Linked List**. The system allows robots to perform tasks in the right order according to priority, dynamically adapt to new tasks, and collaborate in a coordinated fashion. Using this approach, robots can perform tasks more effectively, thus more useful in the healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linked List is a data structure used to store a collection of elements (nodes) in a sequential manner. Unlike arrays, where elements are stored in continuous memory locations, linked lists store elements in different memory locations and are connected using pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data - Stores information (e.g., patient details, task name)<br>\n",
    "Pointer - Connects to the next compartment (node) in the train.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linked List in Our Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The linked list is employed in our Intelligent Robotics Workflow Management project to efficiently manage and schedule robot tasks. It enables task ordering, robots can adapt and adjust their tasks and coordination of multiple robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task List – Medical Tasks Linked List\n",
    "- Robot List – Robot Status & Availability Linked List\n",
    "- Patient List – Patient Monitoring Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works in Our Project\n",
    "- Task Storage: A task (e.g., \"Deliver Medicine\" or \"Monitor Patient\") is stored in a node.\n",
    "- Priority-Based Sequencing: Tasks are ordered based on priority, with sensitive tasks being executed first.\n",
    "- Dynamic Updates: New tasks can be added or removed without disturbing the entire list.\n",
    "- Execution Flow: The robot executes the task at the head of the list, enabling efficient workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "We are achieving Intelligent Robotics Workflow Management in the **Medical Workflow Scheduler** by effectively scheduling and executing medical tasks for robotic assistants. By employing a linked list for task sequencing, real-time priority adaptation, and multi-robot coordination, we develop an effective medical task management system that makes robots smarter and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked List-Based Task Sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tasks are kept in a linked list where each task is assigned a name and priority.\n",
    "- Tasks are automatically sorted by priority (lower value = higher priority).\n",
    "- This makes sure critical tasks are always executed first.\n",
    "### Dynamic Skill Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task Flexibility – Robots can handle different types of medical tasks (e.g., medicine delivery, patient transport, or sample collection).\n",
    "- Real-Time Learning – The system can adjust robot tasks based on workload, emergencies, or hospital needs.\n",
    "- Prioritization System – Robots focus on high-priority tasks first, like emergency medicine delivery.\n",
    "- Error Handling & Recovery – If a robot fails or is busy, another robot can take over the task dynamically.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Collaborative Robot Coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scheduler can be easily extended to schedule tasks for multiple robots.\n",
    "- Various robots can pick tasks from the list according to their capabilities.\n",
    "- This makes workflow smooth and robot collaboration better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOPs concept related to our project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class and Objects\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "A class is a template for creating objects with attributes and methods.\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class that holds real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in our Project:\n",
    "Creation of classes like TaskNode (for tasks), Robot (for managing robots), and WorkflowManager (for task scheduling).\n",
    "Objects will represent tasks, robots, and the workflow itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Encapsulation hides internal data and restricts direct access to it.\n",
    "Data is accessed using methods instead of modifying it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in our Project:\n",
    "Task details (like name, priority, and status) will be stored as private attributes in a TaskNode class.\n",
    "You will create getter and setter methods to access and update task information safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructor (__init__)\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "A constructor is a special method (__init__) that runs when an object is created.\n",
    "It is used to initialize attributes with default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in our Project:\n",
    "The TaskNode class will use __init__ to initialize each task with a name and priority.\n",
    "The Robot class will use __init__ to assign a robot ID and task queue when a new robot is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Abstraction hides complex details and only exposes necessary functionality.\n",
    "It makes code simpler and easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in our Project:\n",
    "Users will interact with simple methods like assign_task(), execute_task(), and display_tasks() without knowing the internal linked list operations.\n",
    "Robots will perform tasks through a RobotManager class that handles the complex logic behind scheduling and coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Polymorphism allows the same function name to have different behaviors in different contexts.\n",
    "Achieved through method overloading (same method, different parameters) and method overriding (child class changes parent class method).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in our Project:\n",
    "Different robot types (SurgicalRobot, DeliveryRobot) may have their own execute_task() method, overriding the base Robot class method.\n",
    "A TaskManager class can have a schedule_task() method that works differently based on the type of robot handling the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Inheritance allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.\n",
    "It promotes code reuse and avoids duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage in our Project:\n",
    "A base Robot class will be created with common attributes (like robot_id, task_queue).\n",
    "Different types of robots (e.g., SurgicalRobot, CleaningRobot, TransportRobot) will inherit from Robot but modify behavior as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Intelligent Robotics Workflow Management project will create a software-based task scheduling system for collaborative robots based on linked lists and OOP concepts. The system will effectively manage robotic task sequencing, optimizing execution, adaptability, and coordination in dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present, the project is still in the planning and initial development stage, and important areas of focus are:\n",
    "- Developing the linked list-based task scheduling structure\n",
    "- Defining collaboration logic for multiple robots\n",
    "- Creating an object-oriented framework for modularity\n",
