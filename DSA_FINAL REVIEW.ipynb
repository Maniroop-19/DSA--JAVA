    "# Hospital Task Scheduler System\n",
    "## Comprehensive Analysis and Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hospital Task Scheduler is an advanced system designed to optimize medical task management in a hospital environment. This system addresses the critical need for efficient resource allocation in healthcare settings by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing prioritized medical tasks\n",
    "- Assigning appropriate robots based on skill requirements\n",
    "- Organizing doctor schedules efficiently\n",
    "- Optimizing workflow based on task priority and timing constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation uses specialized data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient task management, proper priority handling, and optimal robot assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. System Architecture\n",

    "The system follows a modular architecture with four main components:\n",

    "### Main Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TaskNode**: Represents individual medical tasks with priorities\n",
    "2. **PriorityQueue**: Maintains tasks in priority order\n",
    "3. **Robot**: Represents medical robots with specific skills\n",
    "4. **Scheduler**: Central component that manages the entire system\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Structures Used\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Linked List (in PriorityQueue)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation**: The `PriorityQueue` uses a singly linked list where each `TaskNode` has a `next` pointer\n",
    "- **Organization**: Tasks are ordered by `position_score`, with highest scores at the head\n",
    "- **Key Operations**:\n",
    "  - `enqueue`: O(n) - Inserts a task in the correct position\n",
    "  - `dequeue`: O(1) - Removes the head node (highest priority)\n",
    "  - `show_tasks`: O(n) - Traverses the list to display tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Lists (in Scheduler and Robot)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Python lists store collections of objects\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "  - `Scheduler` uses lists to store `robots` and `doctors`\n",
    "  - `Robot` class uses lists to store `skills` and `completed_tasks`\n",
    "- **Key Operations**:\n",
    "  - Appending: O(1) amortized\n",
    "  - Searching: O(n)\n",
    "  - Removing: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Custom priority queue using a linked list \n",
    "- **Priority Logic**: Tasks are prioritized based on calculated `position_score` \n",
    "- **Performance**: O(n) for enqueue operations\n",

    "## Overall Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The project consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`TaskNode`** – Represents individual tasks.\n",

    "## 6. Position Score Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The position score is a critical component that determines task priority:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_position_score(self):\n",
    "    # Convert time to minutes (0-1440 minutes in a day)\n",
    "    time_in_minutes = self.entry_time.hour * 60 + self.entry_time.minute\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Priority score: inverse of priority (1-5) multiplied by 100\n",
    "    # Lower priority number means higher importance\n",
    "    priority_score = (6 - self.priority) * 100\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Time factor: earlier times get higher scores\n",
    "    time_factor = 1440 - time_in_minutes\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Combined weighted score: 70% priority, 30% time\n",
    "    return priority_score * 0.7 + time_factor * 0.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm balances:\n",
    "- **Task Urgency**: Higher priority tasks (1 is highest) get higher scores\n",
    "- **Time Sensitivity**: Earlier tasks are given preference\n",
    "- **Weighting**: Priority has more influence (70%) than time (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. OOP Concepts Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data and methods are bundled within classes (`TaskNode`, `PriorityQueue`, `Robot`, `Scheduler`)\n",
    "- Attributes like `task_id`, `position_score`, and `availability` are accessed through methods\n",
    "- Internal implementation details are hidden from external users\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Scheduler` class abstracts the complexity of task management\n",
    "- Users interact with high-level methods like `add_task` and `assign_robot_to_task`\n",
    "- Internal details of the priority queue implementation are hidden\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Potential for Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current implementation doesn't use inheritance explicitly\n",
    "- Structure allows for potential extensions (e.g., specialized `Robot` subclasses)\n",
    "- Could implement `EmergencyTask` extending `TaskNode` for special handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4 Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `can_perform_task` method in `Robot` could be overridden in subclasses\n",
    "- The priority queue's `enqueue` method works with any `TaskNode` regardless of specifics\n",
    "- Different robot types could implement specialized behavior while maintaining the interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.5 Composition\n",
    "\n",

    "### 8.1 Task Priority Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses a custom priority mechanism instead of Python's built-in heapq:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def enqueue(self, task_node):\n",
    "    self.task_count += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # If queue is empty or new task has higher score than head\n",
    "    if self.head is None or self.head.position_score < task_node.position_score:\n",
    "        task_node.next = self.head\n",
    "        self.head = task_node\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Find the right position to insert based on position_score\n",
    "        temp = self.head\n",
    "        while temp.next and temp.next.position_score >= task_node.position_score:\n",
    "            temp = temp.next\n",
    "        task_node.next = temp.next\n",
    "        temp.next = task_node\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 8.2 Robot Assignment Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def assign_robot_to_task(self):\n",
    "    task = self.tasks.dequeue()\n",
    "    if not task:\n",
    "        print(\"No tasks to assign!\")\n",
    "        return\n",
    "        \n",
    "    available_robots = [robot for robot in self.robots \n",
    "                      if robot.can_perform_task(task.skill_required)]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if available_robots:\n",
    "        robot = available_robots[0]  # Choose first available robot\n",
    "        robot.assign_task(task)\n",
    "        print(f\"{robot.name} has been assigned to Task {task.task_id}\")\n",
    "        return\n",
    "        \n",
    "    print(f\"No available robot with skill '{task.skill_required}'. Task re-added to queue.\")\n",
    "    self.tasks.enqueue(task)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic:\n",
    "1. Gets the highest priority task\n",
    "2. Filters robots by required skill and availability\n",
    "3. Assigns task to first suitable robot or re-enqueues\n",
